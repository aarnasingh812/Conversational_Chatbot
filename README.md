# How to run the code
1. Create a folder (named chatbot)say.
2. Open it with vs code.
3. Open the terminal and select the command prompt.
4.  Then create and activate the Python virtual environment.
5.  Write commands to create environment variable "python -m venv myEnv"
6.  To activate environment variable "mymyEnv\Scripts\activate"                                                                                                                                                     
   Now our myEnv named virtual Environment folder will be created.
   Further, run all the commands in that terminal that has activated virtual environment.
7. Now down all the files from my GitHub in your folder(chatbot) and save them.
8. Run  the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal. To download all the 
   requirements.
9. Finally, run the command "streamlit run app.py". (app.py is the name of Python file)
   It will open the Streamlit app  in the browser with the localhost URL.

Note: I have provided my API keys of the platform providing open source model in the .env file.
